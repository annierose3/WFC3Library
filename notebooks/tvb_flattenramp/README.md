This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates different ways to identify IR exposures with time-variable Helium (1.083 micron) line emission background, and how to correct for it using the "flatten-ramp" technique described in WFC3 ISR 2016-06. This method can be used to correct images affected by a sky background that does not vary across the field of view.

In order to run this Jupyter Notebook, it is recommended to install a recent version of stenv (https://stenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html). If you are using a compatible version of stenv with your device, then no additional packages is needed to run this notebook.

Questions or concerns should be sent to the HST Help Desk (https://stsci.service-now.com/hst).
